title: "Optical Aligment"
---

To do next before 3D imaging:

1.  Laser light beam check and collimation (Collimating lens)
2.  Laser light beam alignments (Collimating lens and Mirror 1, 2 and 3)
3.  Cylindrical lens installation (Cylindrical lens 1 or 2 with x-stage)
4.  Actuators and camera setup (Sample stage and detection optics)
5.  Fluorescence signal check (Sample stage and detection optics)
6.  Follow-up alignments (Cylindrical lens and detection optics; if required)
