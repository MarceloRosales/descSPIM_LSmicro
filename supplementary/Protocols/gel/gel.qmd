Gel embedding procedure:

## Gel embedding

Procedures for tissue clearing and gel embedding.

![](/supplementary/Protocols/Cubic/images/Cubic_workflow-02.png)

-   a, Preparation of CUBIC-R+. This reagent can be easily dissolved by mild heating and stirring.
-   b,c, An incubator with a shaker (b) and a hybridization incubator (c) that we use for steps requiring temperature control for the clearing procedure; inset shows tube containing brain.
-   d, Preparation of 2% agarose--CUBIC solution. Agarose can be dissolved by repeated heating using a microwave and shaking.
-   e, A water bath for the degassing step.
-   f, 2% agarose--CUBIC solution after the degassing step.
-   g, The sample is immersed in 2% agarose--CUBIC solution before gelation.
-   h, A mold for gelation. It is designed for mouse brain.
-   i, x--y view after gelation. Scale bar, 10 mm.
-   j, y--z view after gelation. Scale bar, 5 mm. A margin of 1 mm or more is recommended on the top and bottom of the sample.
-   k, Removing the sample gel from the mold.
-   l, Fixation of the gel on the customized sample holder. All experiments followed the relevant governmental and institutional guidelines for animal experiments.

Steps:

1.  Filtering of CUBIC-R (used for clearing)

2.  Add agarose (2%?)

3.  Mix with vortex

4.  Heating with microwave

5.  Further mix with vortex

6.  Repeat heating and vortex until complete dissolution)

7.  Keep warming with water bath at 60˚C

8.  Cover gel mold with parafilm

9.  Prepare the first layer at 45˚C

10. Remove bubbles and dust

11. Cool down 1st layer to 4˚C for gelation

    Embedding the sample in the 2nd layer (keep worming at 45˚C)

12. Blend the sample in the CUBIC-R/agarose

13. Place sample over the 1st layer

14. Fully embbed the sample in CUBIC-R/agarose 2nd layer

15. Remove bubbles and dusts

16. Cool down 2nd layer to 4˚C for gelation

17. Prepare the 3rd layer at 45˚C

18. Remove bubbles and dusts

19. Make flat plane with slide glass

20. Protect form light

21. Recover the gel from the mold

22. Inmerse in CUBIC-R for storage and equilibration (the precipitates will be dissolved in CUBIC-R)

23. ...
