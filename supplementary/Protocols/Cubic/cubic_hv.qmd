-   Brain samples after delipidation are easily damaged and should be handled with a metal spoon. 
:::

1.  Collection of mouse brain\* 

    1.  Anesthetize the mouse with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium salt (nacalai tesque #02095- 04) in PBS or saline. 

    2.  Transcardially perfuse with 10 mL (4 mL/min) of cold heparin-PBS (+10 U/mL Heparin). 

    3.  Transcardially perfuse 20 mL (6 mL/min) of cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. 

    4.  Dissect the brain from the skull. 

    5.  Post-fix the dissected brain in 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS (\~10 mL/whole brain) for overnight (8-24 h) at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

    6.  Wash the sample in PBS (+0.05% NaN3) for 3 h x 3 times at room temperature with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

\*Refer to Susaki et al. Nature Protocol 10:1709--1727 (2015) for details. 

2.  Delipidation 

    1.  Immerse the fixed sample in 10 mL of 0.5x CUBIC-L (1:1 dilution with distilled water) in the 30 mL tube and incubate it for overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

    2.  Replace to 10-15 mL of 1x CUBIC-L in the 30 mL tube and delipidate for 3-5 days\* at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

        \*If the CUBIC-L treatment is more than 3 days, replace with a new CUBIC-L every 2 to 3 days.

    3.  Wash the sample with 20 mL of PBS (+0.05% NaN3) for 2 h x 3 times (or 2 h x1, overnight x1, 2 h x1) at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\
        \[NOTE\] The tubes should be washed or replaced each time to intensively remove Triton X-100. 

3.  3D nuclear staining 

    1.  Dilute either of nuclear stains in 3-4 mL of 1x HVTM1 3D nuclear staining buffer in the 5 mL tube.\
        DAPI: 1/200\
        BOBO-1: 1/400\
        SYTOX-G: 1/2500\
        PI: 1/100\
        RedDot2: 1/250 

    2.  Immerse the sample in 1x HVTM1 3D nuclear staining buffer containing either of the stains. Incubate the tube with rotation (4-5 rpm) at 37°C for the following periods, protected from light.\
        DAPI: 5 days\
        BOBO-1: 5 days\
        SYTOX-G: 5 days\
        PI: 3 days\
        RedDot2: 3 days\
        \[NOTE\] Increase the volume over 4 mL when the staining depth and signal intensity are insufficient. 

    3.  Wash the sample with 15 mL of 3D nuclear staining wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h x 3 times at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\
        \[NOTE\] If the following antibody staining is not required, proceed to 8) RI matching. 

=== Optional process (start) ===

4.  Enzyme reaction

    1.  Immerse the sample in 15 mL of hyaluronidase reaction buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). (or for 2 h at 37°C)
    2.  Prepare enzyme solution by mixing 75 µL of 20 mg/mL hyaluronidase stock into 425 µL of reaction buffer (final 3 mg/mL in 500 µL).
    3.  Immerse the sample in the 500 µL of enzyme solution in the 15 mL standing tube protected from light for 24 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).

    ::: callout-note
    -   To avoid damage, put the brain so that the dorsal side comes to the bottom of the tube.
    -   Some antibodies are not compatible with the hyaluronidase reaction. Alternatively, Collagenase P can be used (see Nature Communications 2020 for details).
    :::

    4.  Wash the sample in 15 mL of hyaluronidase wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h x 3 times at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).

\
=== Optional process (end) === 

5.  **Preparation for 3D immunostaining**

    Start the following preparatory tasks (1) and (2) 1.5 h prior to the staining procedure. 

    1.  Primary antibody + secondary antibody reaction

        1.  Calculate the required amount (X, Y) of primary and secondary (Fab) antibodies.
            -   Primary antibody: 5 µg/whole brain

                \*For 1 mg/mL product, X = 5/1 = 5 µL

            -   Secondary antibody: anti-Fc Fab, 3.75 µg/whole brain (1:0.75 as the weight ratio)

                \*For 1.5 mg/mL product, Y = 3.75/1.5 = 2.5 µL

        ::: callout-note
        The amount of primary antibody should be determined for each application.

        The amount of secondary antibody should be adjusted according to the degree of noise and signal intensity.
        :::

        2.  Mix X µL of primary antibody and Y µL of secondary antibody in the Protein LoBind 500 µL tube.\
            Incubate it protected from light for 1.5 h at 37°C. 

    2.  Exchange the immersion media with HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer.

        1.  Prepare 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer as follows:

            |                                   |        |
            |-----------------------------------|--------|
            | 2x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer | 7.5 mL |
            | Distilled water                   | 7.5 mL |
            | Total                             | 15 mL  |

        2.  Immerse the sample in 15 mL of 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer in the 30 mL tube. Incubate it protected from light for 1.5 h at a specific staining temperature for the antibody with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).

            ::: callout-note
            A staining temperature of 32°C is generally used. Depending on the antibody, 25°C (room temperature) or 37°C may be optimal. 
            :::

6.  3D Immunostaining

    1.  Prepare antibody staining solution (500 µL per whole brain) as follows:

        |                                   |                   |
        |-----------------------------------|-------------------|
        | 2x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer | 250 µL (final 1x) |
        | 10x HVTM1 additive                | 50 µL (final 1x)  |
        | Distilled water                   | 200-(X+Y) µL      |

        Add the entire volume to the 500 µL tube containing an X+Y µL antibody mixture.

    2.  Transfer the mixed antibody staining solution into the 15 mL standing tube and immerse the buffer-exchanged sample. Incubate it protected from light for 1 week\~ at 32°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).

        ::: callout-note
        \[ \] Shake the tube in an upright position as during the staining.\
        \[ \] To avoid damage, put the brain so that the dorsal side comes to the bottom of the tube.\
        \[ \] Close the lid tightly and wrap the parafilm to prevent evaporation.\
        \[ \] Staining period should be determined for each antibody.\
        \[ \] The amount of HVTM1 additive should be adjusted for each antibody. 
        :::

    3.  To stabilize the 2nd Fab signals, gently shake the staining tube protected from light with a shaker (40-50 rpm/min) for a further 24 h at 4°C.

        ::: callout-note
        \[ \] Shake the tube in an upright position as during the staining.\
        \[ \] If the primary antibody shows a non-specific staining signal at 4°C, this step should be skipped. 
        :::

    4.  Wash the sample in 15 mL of pre-cooled 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 30 min x 2 times at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).

        ::: callout-note
        \[ \] To stabilize the binding of Fab antibodies and reduce the non-specific signal, make the reagents cooled to 4°C prior to washing and post-staining fixation operations.\
        \[ \] In the case that the above 4°C reaction is skipped, wash the sample at the immunostaining temperature. 
        :::

7.  Post-fixation 

    1.  Prepare the fixative solution by diluting the saturated formalin (FA) product to the final 1% in 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer and cool it to 4°C.

        ::: callout-note
        \[ \] The saturated formalin solution contains 35 to 38% formalin. For example, when you use a 37% formalin solution, dilute it with 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer at a ratio of 1:36. 
        :::

    2.  Immerse the sample in 8 mL of 1% FA in the 15 mL standing tube protected from light for 24 h at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

    3.  To accelerate the fixation reaction, further incubate the sample in 1% FA protected from light for 1 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

    4.  Wash the sample in 15 mL of PBS in a 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min) 

8.  RI matching 

    1.  Immerse the sample in 15 mL of 0.5x CUBIC-R+ (1:1 diluted with water) in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 24 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

    2.  Exchange with 15 mL (or 30 mL if gel embedding is performed) of 1x CUBIC-R+ for 2 days at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). 

    3.  Use for microscopic observation (embed the sample in gel if necessary).
