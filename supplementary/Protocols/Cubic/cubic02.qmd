Protocol for Imaging and Analysis of Mouse Tumor Models with CUBIC Tissue Clearin. [Article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7757565/){target="_blank"}.

Compleate protocol for Mouse Tumor Models.

### Whole-mouse Clearing

Mouse whole-Body Clearing (without decalcification process)

**Application: Whole Adult Mouse**

-   **Pre-Treatment: 200 mL 50% CUBIC-L at 37°C O/N**
-   **Delipidation: 200 mL CUBIC-L at 37°C for 5 days**
    -   (CUBIC-L refreshed on days 1, 2, and 4)
        -   Delipidation has reached its endpoint when:
            -   Partial transparency is acheived
            -   CUBIC-L remains colorless after incubation with sample
-   **Pre-Treatment: 200 mL 50% CUBIC-R+(M) at RT O/N**
-   **RI Matching: 200 mL CUBIC-R+(M) at RT O/N**
    -   Reagent Totals (for a 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm container):
        -   CUBIC-L : 700 mL
        -   CUBIC-R+(M) : 300 mL Delipidation has reached its endpoint when:

†Use a container that allows you to submerge your whole specimen.\
†For nuclear staining, we recommend using a solution of 30 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) and 1.5M NaCl in PBS.

FA: formaldehyde, O/N: overnight, PFA: paraformaldehyde, RT: room temperature.
