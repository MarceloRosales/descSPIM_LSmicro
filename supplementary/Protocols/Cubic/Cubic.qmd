## Protocols

-   **Basic protocol:** Clearing of whole mouse bodies as well as animal organs can be achieved by using two reagents in sequence:

1.  CUBIC-L \[T3740\] for delipidation and either
2.  CUBIC-R+(N) \[T3983\] or CUBIC-R+(M) \[T3741\] for RI matching.

The difference between CUBIC-R+(N) \[T3983\] and CUBIC-R+(M) \[T3741\]:

CUBIC-R+(N) is inexpensive and easier to handle because it raises less precipitation. The fluorescence signal may decay, but the fluorescence signals of samples in CUBIC-R+(N) can be observed for several days after immersion.

CUBIC-R+(M) is superior in retaining the fluorescence signal. However, at low temperatures such as in winter, it may precipitate. In that case, it can be resolved by placing the sample at 37°C for a few days. For these reasons, it is recommended to try CUBIC-R+(N) first and then use CUBIC-R+(M) if fluorescence signal cannot be found.

-   **Optional protocol:** The following products can easily clear tissues, such as bones or highly fatty tissues which were previously difficult to clear. CUBIC-B \[T3780\] for bone CUBIC-HL \[T3781\] for highly fatty tissues

-   **For efficiently aiding with perfusion fixation for mouse perfusion:** CUBIC-P \[T3782\]

-   **Expansion protocol:** The following products can clear tissues with expansion. (Swell/expand tissues for improved visibility.) CUBIC-X1 \[T3866\] for expansion tissues CUBIC-X2 \[T3867\] for RI matching with keeping the expanded size of tissues

-   **For staining thick and large specimens uniformly** CUBIC-HV™1 3D immunostaining kit \[C3717\] for 3D immunostaining CUBIC-HV™1 3D nuclear staining kit \[C3709\] for 3D nuclear staining

-   Tissue expansion enables acquisition of images easy.

-   Preserve the fluorescent protein signals except CUBIC-HL \[T3781\].

-   Using light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) or confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) enables the whole-organ / body imaging at a cellular resolution.

### Mouse whole-Body Clearing (decalcification??) 

![](images/mouse_wholebody_cleraing_img.png)

**Application: Whole Adult Mouse**

-   **Pre-Treatment: 200 mL 50% CUBIC-L at 37°C O/N**
-   **Delipidation: 200 mL CUBIC-L at 37°C for 5 days**
    -   (CUBIC-L refreshed on days 1, 2, and 4)
        -   Delipidation has reached its endpoint when:
            -   Partial transparency is acheived
            -   CUBIC-L remains colorless after incubation with sample
-   **Pre-Treatment: 200 mL 50% CUBIC-R+(M) at RT O/N**
-   **RI Matching: 200 mL CUBIC-R+(M) at RT O/N**
    -   Reagent Totals (for a 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm container):
        -   CUBIC-L : 700 mL
        -   CUBIC-R+(M) : 300 mL Delipidation has reached its endpoint when:

†Use a container that allows you to submerge your whole specimen.\
†For nuclear staining, we recommend using a solution of 30 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) and 1.5M NaCl in PBS.

FA: formaldehyde, O/N: overnight, PFA: paraformaldehyde, RT: room temperature.

### Decalcification (Whole Mouse).

### Overview of the advanced CUBIC pipeline in whole-organ cell profiling. 

![](images/Cubic_workflow-01.png)

This pipeline comprises three major stages

1.  Tissue clearing,
2.  Imaging and
3.  Image analysis

Two kinds of clearing protocols:

1.  **Rapid and highquality protocol** using CUBIC-L and CUBIC-R+ (Step 4A), which takes at least 7 d for adult mouse brain, and
2.  **Tissue expansion protocol for high-resolution imaging** using CUBIC-X (Step 4B), which takes up to 21 d for adult mouse brain.

-   In addition, both protocols can include staining with an appropriate nuclei-staining dye, which takes 4 d.
-   Rapid volumetric imaging can be performed with a customized LSFM with the MOVIE system (Steps 6--12).
-   From the collected volumetric images, cells are detected by GPUs and CPUs and converted to point data.
-   When analyzing the mouse brain, the result data are analyzed with CUBIC-Atlas.

### Procedures for tissue clearing and gel embedding.
