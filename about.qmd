## About descSPIM

descSPIM : affordable but versatile light-sheet microscopy system for tissue clearing end users

![descSPIM_CAD_for_GitHub_middle](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/126061350/237289830-f2d5b706-65d0-48b8-8c36-c4be8a2e1a56.png){group="gallery01"}

### What is descSPIM?

descSPIM is a lightsheet microscopy system that we designed to meet the unmet needs of researchers who are using tissue clearing techniques. The system offers a low-cost and easy-to-use solution for 3D imaging of cleared tissue samples that requires little expertise and cost. Most optical components are readily available from a single vendor and can be readily assembled using the instructions provided. These minimal optical parts are arranged on a small optical breadboard. In contrast to existing lightsheet systems, descSPIM is intended to be simple to install, build, and operate, even for end users with no prior experience in optics. descSPIM is also highly expandable and can be customized to suit a variety of applications, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of research projects. With descSPIM, researchers can easily achieve practical-quality 3D imaging of cleared specimens in a daily experiments.

![descSPIM_cost_vs_expertise_for_GitHub (1)\_middle](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/126061350/237290075-952cae5c-883a-4f3d-b6ba-bc8a15625755.png){group="gallery01"}

The main features of descSPIM are: Easy-to-build Easy-to-operate (use a cuvette / no oil chamber) Affordable (\$20k-50k for descSPIM-basic, depending on the number of lasers) Compact (all parts on a 300 mm x 450 mm breadboard)Versatile (highly expandable and customizable)## Who is the descSPIM for?

Researchers interested in using Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) for cleared tissue imaging

### What are ideal imaging applications for a descSPIM?

-   Macro- to meso-scale imaging of 3D volumetric samples prepared by tissue clearing techniques with strong efficiency (CUBIC, BABB, DISCO, SHIELDs etc.)
-   Visualization of cell populations or anatomical structures (e.g. blood vessels, plaques) with cellular to sub-cellular resolutions

## Guide to install

It is recommended to start learning

[Basic of optics]() and

[Cleared sample preparation](),

[descSPIM-basic]().

Add-on functions are developed to be compatible with the basic system.

a\. A conventional system with a positionally fixed medium chamber fulfilled with a clearing reagent or a RI-matched immersion oil (e.g., n = 1.52). The sample is moved along the z-axis within the chamber. In this case, the ratio of A (the distance from the chamber wall to the light-sheet illumination, with RI of the immersion reagent) and B (the distance from the objective lens to the chamber wall, with RI of the air (1.0)) is fixed.

b\. descSPIM sample imaging method employing a cuvette as a sample container. In this case, due to the movement of the sample chamber (the cuvette) during imaging, the ratio of A and B is altered, resulting in defocus. descSPIM applies synchronized movement of the sample stage (zsample) and the detection optics (zdetect) to prevent the defocus. See Supplementary Fig. 4 and Methods for details on how to calculate the synchronous speed correction value (the relative velocity of two actuators).

########## summary

Different bone types harbor specialized physiological processes that are key for proper development and survival of the organism, such as replenishment of hematopoietic cells, growth, and remodeling of the bone during healthy and diseased state. Whole-bone clearing, light-sheet imaging with a custom-built microscope, and dedicated computational methods for counting fluorescently labeled cells. This trio of methods were used to visualize and quantify the total number of osteoprogenitors contained within a volume of mouse bone and map their 3D spatial distribution in response to a sclerostin antibody (Scl-Ab), a boneforming agent.

odontoblasts, which are differentiated from DPSCs and located at the pulp-dentin interface, perform the specialized function of dentin maintenance by controlling the mineralization of reactive dentin and represent the first barrier against pathogens.

In addition, the 3D distribution of immune cells expressing CD11cYFP or CX3CR1-GFP in the dental pulp, the recruitment of granulocytes, and the vascular changes in a carious tooth were successfully visualized at the cellular level.

**Potential ideas:**

Since there are not many articles using light-sheet microscope, there is room for:

1.  Number of osteoprogenitors contained within a volume of mouse mandible (molar) and map their 3D spatial distribution. ref. @greenbaum2017
2.  Volumetric (3D) Distribution of vascular network in relation to Progenitor cells (Osteo, cementoblasts) in PDL and calvaria.
3.  Distribution of neurovascular network in PDL. Does mechanical response is only by cell to cell comunication or is there a neural response?
4.  Calcium dynamics in bone repair (in calvaria defect, implant and tooth movement of PDL) like in sparks et al.
