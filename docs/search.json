    "text": "descSPIM : affordable but versatile light-sheet microscopy system for tissue clearing end users\n\n\ndescSPIM_CAD_for_GitHub_middle\n\n\n\ndescSPIM is a lightsheet microscopy system that we designed to meet the unmet needs of researchers who are using tissue clearing techniques. The system offers a low-cost and easy-to-use solution for 3D imaging of cleared tissue samples that requires little expertise and cost. Most optical components are readily available from a single vendor and can be readily assembled using the instructions provided. These minimal optical parts are arranged on a small optical breadboard. In contrast to existing lightsheet systems, descSPIM is intended to be simple to install, build, and operate, even for end users with no prior experience in optics. descSPIM is also highly expandable and can be customized to suit a variety of applications, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of research projects. With descSPIM, researchers can easily achieve practical-quality 3D imaging of cleared specimens in a daily experiments.\n\n\ndescSPIM_cost_vs_expertise_for_GitHub (1)_middle\n\n\nThe main features of descSPIM are: Easy-to-build Easy-to-operate (use a cuvette / no oil chamber) Affordable ($20k-50k for descSPIM-basic, depending on the number of lasers) Compact (all parts on a 300 mm x 450 mm breadboard)Versatile (highly expandable and customizable)## Who is the descSPIM for?\nResearchers interested in using Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) for cleared tissue imaging\n\n\nMacro- to meso-scale imaging of 3D volumetric samples prepared by tissue clearing techniques with strong efficiency (CUBIC, BABB, DISCO, SHIELDs etc.)\nVisualization of cell populations or anatomical structures (e.g. blood vessels, plaques) with cellular to sub-cellular resolutions"

(or for 2 h at 37°C)\nPrepare enzyme solution by mixing 75 µL of 20 mg/mL hyaluronidase stock into 425 µL of reaction buffer (final 3 mg/mL in 500 µL).\nImmerse the sample in the 500 µL of enzyme solution in the 15 mL standing tube protected from light for 24 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid damage, put the brain so that the dorsal side comes to the bottom of the tube.\nSome antibodies are not compatible with the hyaluronidase reaction. Alternatively, Collagenase P can be used (see Nature Communications 2020 for details).\n\n\n\n\nWash the sample in 15 mL of hyaluronidase wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h x 3 times at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n=== Optional process (end) === \n\nPreparation for 3D immunostaining\nStart the following preparatory tasks (1) and (2) 1.5 h prior to the staining procedure. \n\nPrimary antibody + secondary antibody reaction\n\nCalculate the required amount (X, Y) of primary and secondary (Fab) antibodies.\n\nPrimary antibody: 5 µg/whole brain\n*For 1 mg/mL product, X = 5/1 = 5 µL\nSecondary antibody: anti-Fc Fab, 3.75 µg/whole brain (1:0.75 as the weight ratio)\n*For 1.5 mg/mL product, Y = 3.75/1.5 = 2.5 µL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe amount of primary antibody should be determined for each application.\nThe amount of secondary antibody should be adjusted according to the degree of noise and signal intensity.\n\n\n\nMix X µL of primary antibody and Y µL of secondary antibody in the Protein LoBind 500 µL tube.\nIncubate it protected from light for 1.5 h at 37°C. \n\nExchange the immersion media with HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer.\n\nPrepare 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer as follows:\n\n\n\n2x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer\n7.5 mL\n\n\nDistilled water\n7.5 mL\n\n\nTotal\n15 mL\n\n\n\nImmerse the sample in 15 mL of 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer in the 30 mL tube. Incubate it protected from light for 1.5 h at a specific staining temperature for the antibody with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA staining temperature of 32°C is generally used. Depending on the antibody, 25°C (room temperature) or 37°C may be optimal. \n\n\n\n\n3D Immunostaining\n\nPrepare antibody staining solution (500 µL per whole brain) as follows:\n\n\n\n2x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer\n250 µL (final 1x)\n\n\n10x HVTM1 additive\n50 µL (final 1x)\n\n\nDistilled water\n200-(X+Y) µL\n\n\n\nAdd the entire volume to the 500 µL tube containing an X+Y µL antibody mixture.\nTransfer the mixed antibody staining solution into the 15 mL standing tube and immerse the buffer-exchanged sample. Incubate it protected from light for 1 week~ at 32°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] Shake the tube in an upright position as during the staining.\n[ ] To avoid damage, put the brain so that the dorsal side comes to the bottom of the tube.\n[ ] Close the lid tightly and wrap the parafilm to prevent evaporation.\n[ ] Staining period should be determined for each antibody.\n[ ] The amount of HVTM1 additive should be adjusted for each antibody. \n\n\nTo stabilize the 2nd Fab signals, gently shake the staining tube protected from light with a shaker (40-50 rpm/min) for a further 24 h at 4°C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] Shake the tube in an upright position as during the staining.\n[ ] If the primary antibody shows a non-specific staining signal at 4°C, this step should be skipped. \n\n\nWash the sample in 15 mL of pre-cooled 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 30 min x 2 times at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] To stabilize the binding of Fab antibodies and reduce the non-specific signal, make the reagents cooled to 4°C prior to washing and post-staining fixation operations.\n[ ] In the case that the above 4°C reaction is skipped, wash the sample at the immunostaining temperature. \n\n\n\nPost-fixation \n\nPrepare the fixative solution by diluting the saturated formalin (FA) product to the final 1% in 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer and cool it to 4°C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] The saturated formalin solution contains 35 to 38% formalin. For example, when you use a 37% formalin solution, dilute it with 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer at a ratio of 1:36. \n\n\nImmerse the sample in 8 mL of 1% FA in the 15 mL standing tube protected from light for 24 h at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nTo accelerate the fixation reaction, further incubate the sample in 1% FA protected from light for 1 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nWash the sample in 15 mL of PBS in a 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min) \n\nRI matching \n\nImmerse the sample in 15 mL of 0.5x CUBIC-R+ (1:1 diluted with water) in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 24 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nExchange with 15 mL (or 30 mL if gel embedding is performed) of 1x CUBIC-R+ for 2 days at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nUse for microscopic observation (embed the sample in gel if necessary).\n\n\n---\nhttps://www.cubicstars.com/cubic-lr/index.html\n---"

It is required to adjust the volume and reaction time according to sample size.\nAll shaking steps except for enzyme reaction, immunostaining, and 4°C reaction are performed with the tube in the horizontal position.\nBrain samples after delipidation are easily damaged and should be handled with a metal spoon. \n\n\n\n\nCollection of mouse brain* \n\nAnesthetize the mouse with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium salt (nacalai tesque #02095- 04) in PBS or saline. \nTranscardially perfuse with 10 mL (4 mL/min) of cold heparin-PBS (+10 U/mL Heparin). \nTranscardially perfuse 20 mL (6 mL/min) of cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. \nDissect the brain from the skull. \nPost-fix the dissected brain in 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS (~10 mL/whole brain) for overnight (8-24 h) at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nWash the sample in PBS (+0.05% NaN3) for 3 h x 3 times at room temperature with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \n\n\n*Refer to Susaki et al. Nature Protocol 10:1709–1727 (2015) for details. \n\nDelipidation \n\nImmerse the fixed sample in 10 mL of 0.5x CUBIC-L (1:1 dilution with distilled water) in the 30 mL tube and incubate it for overnight at room temperature with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nReplace to 10-15 mL of 1x CUBIC-L in the 30 mL tube and delipidate for 3-5 days* at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \n*If the CUBIC-L treatment is more than 3 days, replace with a new CUBIC-L every 2 to 3 days.\nWash the sample with 20 mL of PBS (+0.05% NaN3) for 2 h x 3 times (or 2 h x1, overnight x1, 2 h x1) at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n[NOTE] The tubes should be washed or replaced each time to intensively remove Triton X-100. \n\n3D nuclear staining \n\nDilute either of nuclear stains in 3-4 mL of 1x HVTM1 3D nuclear staining buffer in the 5 mL tube.\nDAPI: 1/200\nBOBO-1: 1/400\nSYTOX-G: 1/2500\nPI: 1/100\nRedDot2: 1/250 \nImmerse the sample in 1x HVTM1 3D nuclear staining buffer containing either of the stains. Incubate the tube with rotation (4-5 rpm) at 37°C for the following periods, protected from light.\nDAPI: 5 days\nBOBO-1: 5 days\nSYTOX-G: 5 days\nPI: 3 days\nRedDot2: 3 days\n[NOTE] Increase the volume over 4 mL when the staining depth and signal intensity are insufficient. \nWash the sample with 15 mL of 3D nuclear staining wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h x 3 times at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n[NOTE] If the following antibody staining is not required, proceed to 8) RI matching. \n\n\n=== Optional process (start) ===\n\nEnzyme reaction\n\nImmerse the sample in 15 mL of hyaluronidase reaction buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). (or for 2 h at 37°C)\nPrepare enzyme solution by mixing 75 µL of 20 mg/mL hyaluronidase stock into 425 µL of reaction buffer (final 3 mg/mL in 500 µL).\nImmerse the sample in the 500 µL of enzyme solution in the 15 mL standing tube protected from light for 24 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid damage, put the brain so that the dorsal side comes to the bottom of the tube.\nSome antibodies are not compatible with the hyaluronidase reaction. Alternatively, Collagenase P can be used (see Nature Communications 2020 for details).\n\n\n\n\nWash the sample in 15 mL of hyaluronidase wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h x 3 times at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n=== Optional process (end) === \n\nPreparation for 3D immunostaining\nStart the following preparatory tasks (1) and (2) 1.5 h prior to the staining procedure. \n\nPrimary antibody + secondary antibody reaction\n\nCalculate the required amount (X, Y) of primary and secondary (Fab) antibodies.\n\nPrimary antibody: 5 µg/whole brain\n*For 1 mg/mL product, X = 5/1 = 5 µL\nSecondary antibody: anti-Fc Fab, 3.75 µg/whole brain (1:0.75 as the weight ratio)\n*For 1.5 mg/mL product, Y = 3.75/1.5 = 2.5 µL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe amount of primary antibody should be determined for each application.\nThe amount of secondary antibody should be adjusted according to the degree of noise and signal intensity.\n\n\n\nMix X µL of primary antibody and Y µL of secondary antibody in the Protein LoBind 500 µL tube.\nIncubate it protected from light for 1.5 h at 37°C. \n\nExchange the immersion media with HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer.\n\nPrepare 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer as follows:\n\n\n\n2x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer\n7.5 mL\n\n\nDistilled water\n7.5 mL\n\n\nTotal\n15 mL\n\n\n\nImmerse the sample in 15 mL of 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer in the 30 mL tube. Incubate it protected from light for 1.5 h at a specific staining temperature for the antibody with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA staining temperature of 32°C is generally used. Depending on the antibody, 25°C (room temperature) or 37°C may be optimal. \n\n\n\n\n3D Immunostaining\n\nPrepare antibody staining solution (500 µL per whole brain) as follows:\n\n\n\n2x HVTM1 3D immunostaining buffer\n250 µL (final 1x)\n\n\n10x HVTM1 additive\n50 µL (final 1x)\n\n\nDistilled water\n200-(X+Y) µL\n\n\n\nAdd the entire volume to the 500 µL tube containing an X+Y µL antibody mixture.\nTransfer the mixed antibody staining solution into the 15 mL standing tube and immerse the buffer-exchanged sample. Incubate it protected from light for 1 week~ at 32°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] Shake the tube in an upright position as during the staining.\n[ ] To avoid damage, put the brain so that the dorsal side comes to the bottom of the tube.\n[ ] Close the lid tightly and wrap the parafilm to prevent evaporation.\n[ ] Staining period should be determined for each antibody.\n[ ] The amount of HVTM1 additive should be adjusted for each antibody. \n\n\nTo stabilize the 2nd Fab signals, gently shake the staining tube protected from light with a shaker (40-50 rpm/min) for a further 24 h at 4°C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] Shake the tube in an upright position as during the staining.\n[ ] If the primary antibody shows a non-specific staining signal at 4°C, this step should be skipped. \n\n\nWash the sample in 15 mL of pre-cooled 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 30 min x 2 times at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] To stabilize the binding of Fab antibodies and reduce the non-specific signal, make the reagents cooled to 4°C prior to washing and post-staining fixation operations.\n[ ] In the case that the above 4°C reaction is skipped, wash the sample at the immunostaining temperature. \n\n\n\nPost-fixation \n\nPrepare the fixative solution by diluting the saturated formalin (FA) product to the final 1% in 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer and cool it to 4°C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n[ ] The saturated formalin solution contains 35 to 38% formalin. For example, when you use a 37% formalin solution, dilute it with 1x HVTM1 3D immunostaining wash buffer at a ratio of 1:36. \n\n\nImmerse the sample in 8 mL of 1% FA in the 15 mL standing tube protected from light for 24 h at 4°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nTo accelerate the fixation reaction, further incubate the sample in 1% FA protected from light for 1 h at 37°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nWash the sample in 15 mL of PBS in a 30 mL tube protected from light for 2 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min) \n\nRI matching \n\nImmerse the sample in 15 mL of 0.5x CUBIC-R+ (1:1 diluted with water) in the 30 mL tube protected from light for 24 h at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nExchange with 15 mL (or 30 mL if gel embedding is performed) of 1x CUBIC-R+ for 2 days at 25°C with gentle shaking (40-50 rpm/min). \nUse for microscopic observation (embed the sample in gel if necessary).\n\n\n---\nhttps://www.cubicstars.com/cubic-lr/index.html\n---"
