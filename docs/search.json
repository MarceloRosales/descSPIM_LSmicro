    "text": "descSPIM : affordable but versatile light-sheet microscopy system for tissue clearing end users\n\n\ndescSPIM_CAD_for_GitHub_middle\n\n\n\ndescSPIM is a lightsheet microscopy system that we designed to meet the unmet needs of researchers who are using tissue clearing techniques. The system offers a low-cost and easy-to-use solution for 3D imaging of cleared tissue samples that requires little expertise and cost. Most optical components are readily available from a single vendor and can be readily assembled using the instructions provided. These minimal optical parts are arranged on a small optical breadboard. In contrast to existing lightsheet systems, descSPIM is intended to be simple to install, build, and operate, even for end users with no prior experience in optics. descSPIM is also highly expandable and can be customized to suit a variety of applications, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of research projects. With descSPIM, researchers can easily achieve practical-quality 3D imaging of cleared specimens in a daily experiments.\n\n\ndescSPIM_cost_vs_expertise_for_GitHub (1)_middle\n\n\nThe main features of descSPIM are: Easy-to-build Easy-to-operate (use a cuvette / no oil chamber) Affordable ($20k-50k for descSPIM-basic, depending on the number of lasers) Compact (all parts on a 300 mm x 450 mm breadboard)Versatile (highly expandable and customizable)## Who is the descSPIM for?\nResearchers interested in using Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) for cleared tissue imaging\n\n\nMacro- to meso-scale imaging of 3D volumetric samples prepared by tissue clearing techniques with strong efficiency (CUBIC, BABB, DISCO, SHIELDs etc.)\nVisualization of cell populations or anatomical structures (e.g. blood vessels, plaques) with cellular to sub-cellular resolutions"

    "text": "DescSPIM and OpenSPIM\nDescSPIM and OpenSPIM are not the same organization.\n\nDescSPIM\nDescSPIM (Developing a Spinning-Disk Confocal Selective-Plane Illumination Microscope) is a project focused on developing an open-source selective-plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) system. It aims to create a modular and customizable SPIM platform that can be accessible to researchers and scientists for their imaging needs. The DescSPIM project focuses on hardware design, software development, and documentation related to SPIM systems.\n\n\nOpenSPIM\nOpenSPIM is a separate initiative that also aims to develop open-source SPIM systems. OpenSPIM is a collaborative effort by multiple researchers and institutions with the goal of providing an accessible and affordable SPIM solution. They focus on designing, building, and sharing hardware and software resources for SPIM.\nthe web page and info are available at OpenSPIM.org.\nWhile both DescSPIM and OpenSPIM share a common goal of advancing open-source SPIM technology, they are distinct projects with separate teams and communities involved in their development.\nLight sheet microscopy offers several advantages over traditional microscopy techniques. It provides fast acquisition rates, high resolution, and the ability to capture three-dimensional images over long periods without significant photodamage. This makes it particularly suitable for studying dynamic processes in living organisms, such as developmental biology, neuroscience, and cell biology."

    "text": "Protocols\n\nBasic protocol: Clearing of whole mouse bodies as well as animal organs can be achieved by using two reagents in sequence:\n\n\nCUBIC-L [T3740] for delipidation and either\nCUBIC-R+(N) [T3983] or CUBIC-R+(M) [T3741] for RI matching.\n\nThe difference between CUBIC-R+(N) [T3983] and CUBIC-R+(M) [T3741]:\nCUBIC-R+(N) is inexpensive and easier to handle because it raises less precipitation. The fluorescence signal may decay, but the fluorescence signals of samples in CUBIC-R+(N) can be observed for several days after immersion.\nCUBIC-R+(M) is superior in retaining the fluorescence signal. However, at low temperatures such as in winter, it may precipitate. In that case, it can be resolved by placing the sample at 37°C for a few days. For these reasons, it is recommended to try CUBIC-R+(N) first and then use CUBIC-R+(M) if fluorescence signal cannot be found.\n\nOptional protocol: The following products can easily clear tissues, such as bones or highly fatty tissues which were previously difficult to clear. CUBIC-B [T3780] for bone CUBIC-HL [T3781] for highly fatty tissues\nFor efficiently aiding with perfusion fixation for mouse perfusion: CUBIC-P [T3782]\nExpansion protocol: The following products can clear tissues with expansion. (Swell/expand tissues for improved visibility.) CUBIC-X1 [T3866] for expansion tissues CUBIC-X2 [T3867] for RI matching with keeping the expanded size of tissues\nFor staining thick and large specimens uniformly CUBIC-HV™1 3D immunostaining kit [C3717] for 3D immunostaining CUBIC-HV™1 3D nuclear staining kit [C3709] for 3D nuclear staining\nTissue expansion enables acquisition of images easy.\nPreserve the fluorescent protein signals except CUBIC-HL [T3781].\nUsing light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) or confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) enables the whole-organ / body imaging at a cellular resolution.\n\n\nMouse whole-Body Clearing (decalcification??)\n\nApplication: Whole Adult Mouse\n\nPre-Treatment: 200 mL 50% CUBIC-L at 37°C O/N\nDelipidation: 200 mL CUBIC-L at 37°C for 5 days\n\n(CUBIC-L refreshed on days 1, 2, and 4)\n\nDelipidation has reached its endpoint when:\n\nPartial transparency is acheived\nCUBIC-L remains colorless after incubation with sample\n\n\n\nPre-Treatment: 200 mL 50% CUBIC-R+(M) at RT O/N\nRI Matching: 200 mL CUBIC-R+(M) at RT O/N\n\nReagent Totals (for a 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm container):\n\nCUBIC-L : 700 mL\nCUBIC-R+(M) : 300 mL Delipidation has reached its endpoint when:\n\n\n\n†Use a container that allows you to submerge your whole specimen.\n†For nuclear staining, we recommend using a solution of 30 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) and 1.5M NaCl in PBS.\nFA: formaldehyde, O/N: overnight, PFA: paraformaldehyde, RT: room temperature.\n\n\nDecalcification (Whole Mouse).\n\n\n\nOverview of the advanced CUBIC pipeline in whole-organ cell profiling.\n\nThis pipeline comprises three major stages\n\nTissue clearing,\nImaging and\nImage analysis\n\nTwo kinds of clearing protocols:\n\nRapid and highquality protocol using CUBIC-L and CUBIC-R+ (Step 4A), which takes at least 7 d for adult mouse brain, and\nTissue expansion protocol for high-resolution imaging using CUBIC-X (Step 4B), which takes up to 21 d for adult mouse brain.\n\n\nIn addition, both protocols can include staining with an appropriate nuclei-staining dye, which takes 4 d.\nRapid volumetric imaging can be performed with a customized LSFM with the MOVIE system (Steps 6–12).\nFrom the collected volumetric images, cells are detected by GPUs and CPUs and converted to point data.\nWhen analyzing the mouse brain, the result data are analyzed with CUBIC-Atlas.\n\n\n\nProcedures for tissue clearing and gel embedding.\n\n\na, Preparation of CUBIC-R+. This reagent can be easily dissolved by mild heating and stirring.\nb,c, An incubator with a shaker (b) and a hybridization incubator (c) that we use for steps requiring temperature control for the clearing procedure; inset shows tube containing brain.\nd, Preparation of 2% agarose–CUBIC solution.
