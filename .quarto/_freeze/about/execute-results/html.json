The system offers a low-cost and easy-to-use solution for 3D imaging of cleared tissue samples that requires little expertise and cost. Most optical components are readily available from a single vendor and can be readily assembled using the instructions provided. These minimal optical parts are arranged on a small optical breadboard. In contrast to existing lightsheet systems, descSPIM is intended to be simple to install, build, and operate, even for end users with no prior experience in optics. descSPIM is also highly expandable and can be customized to suit a variety of applications, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of research projects. With descSPIM, researchers can easily achieve practical-quality 3D imaging of cleared specimens in a daily experiments.\n\n![descSPIM_cost_vs_expertise_for_GitHub (1)\\_middle](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/126061350/237290075-952cae5c-883a-4f3d-b6ba-bc8a15625755.png){group=\"gallery01\"}\n\nThe main features of descSPIM are: Easy-to-build Easy-to-operate (use a cuvette / no oil chamber) Affordable (\\$20k-50k for descSPIM-basic, depending on the number of lasers) Compact (all parts on a 300 mm x 450 mm breadboard)Versatile (highly expandable and customizable)## Who is the descSPIM for?\n\nResearchers interested in using Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) for cleared tissue imaging\n\n### What are ideal imaging applications for a descSPIM?\n\n-   Macro- to meso-scale imaging of 3D volumetric samples prepared by tissue clearing techniques with strong efficiency (CUBIC, BABB, DISCO, SHIELDs etc.)\n-   Visualization of cell populations or anatomical structures (e.g. blood vessels, plaques) with cellular to sub-cellular resolutions\n\n## Guide to install\n\nIt is recommended to start learning\n\n[Basic of optics]() and\n\n[Cleared sample preparation](),\n\n[descSPIM-basic]().\n\nAdd-on functions are developed to be compatible with the basic system.\n\nRelated codes can be available here: [Data processing](https://github.com/dbsb-juntendo/descSPIM/blob/main/DOCs/Data%20processing.md)\n\n## Terms and Conditions\n\nBy using descSPIM, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions:\n\n-   This system is only available for academic use.

A conventional system with a positionally fixed medium chamber fulfilled with a clearing reagent or a RI-matched immersion oil (e.g., n = 1.52). The sample is moved along the z-axis within the chamber. In this case, the ratio of A (the distance from the chamber wall to the light-sheet illumination, with RI of the immersion reagent) and B (the distance from the objective lens to the chamber wall, with RI of the air (1.0)) is fixed.\n\nb\\. descSPIM sample imaging method employing a cuvette as a sample container. In this case, due to the movement of the sample chamber (the cuvette) during imaging, the ratio of A and B is altered, resulting in defocus. descSPIM applies synchronized movement of the sample stage (zsample) and the detection optics (zdetect) to prevent the defocus. See Supplementary Fig. 4 and Methods for details on how to calculate the synchronous speed correction value (the relative velocity of two actuators).\n\n### Workflow\n\n![Workflow](images/Screenshot%20at%20Jun%2002%2012-38-06.png){group=\"gallery01\"}\n\n## Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy - Applications in research\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSPIM_Apps_ideas.docx <- \"/Users/marcelorosales/Box Sync/Niigata Uni Box/Books-Notes/Notes/SPIM_Apps_ideas.docx\"\n#open in mac OS\nsystem(paste(\"open\", shQuote(SPIM_Apps_ideas.docx)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThey use BIO-33 polymer index-math to water @han2021\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MaPPjqE-ug\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n```\n\n<https://youtu.be/-MaPPjqE-ug>\n\nshort code\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/-MaPPjqE-ug >}}\n\n\n\n-   Microfluidics\n-   Neural transports (fly wings)\n-   Isotropic imaging\n-   Functional imaging...\n-   Segmenting cells in a volume...
